# Colab

1. You can fork a copy of this repo and clone to your computer. 

2. Create a new branch using `git checkout -b BRANCHNAME`

3. Commit the code and push to a new branch, and open a pull request.

The rule of thumb is that don't push code to master branch directly.


# Optimized carry-lookahead 32 bit adder

The idea is adapated from the 50.002 2D handout.
